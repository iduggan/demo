##About Me

<img src="assets/bella_grad.jpg" alt="photo_of_me" width="360" height="448">
   
My name is Isabella Duggan and I am currently completing my Master's of Science in Biology at Villanova University, and working as a research assistant in the R.K. Wieder lab.

I completed my undergraduate studies in May of 2022 from Eastern University in St. David's, Pennsylvania with my BS in Environmental Science and a minor in Political Science. While completing my undergraduate degree in an accelerated program, I worked part-time for Pennsylvania Sea Grant on their science communications team which I continued in a full-time capacity upon graduation, a role I worked in up until beginning my graduate studies.
