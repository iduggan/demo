#About Me

My name is Isabella Duggan and I am currently completing my     Masters of Science in Biology at Villanova University, and working as a research assistant in the [R.K. Wieder lab.](https://rwieder.clasit.org/research/)

I completed my undergraduate studies in May of 2022, graduating from Eastern University in St. David's, PA with my BS in Environmental Science and a minor in Political Science. 

During my undergraduate studies I worked part-time for Pennsylvania Sea Grant on their science communications team and on research at Eastern, studying the impacts to planarian regeneration ability and development after ingesting microplastics.

After graduating in 2022 I continued working with Pennsylvania Sea Grant as a Science Communications fellow. In my time with Sea Grant I worked with education, research, and outreach staff, and helped create their new website: [Pennsylvania Sea Grant Website](https://seagrant.psu.edu/). I look forward to returning to the research environment through my Masters studies.
